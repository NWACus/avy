# Developer Environment

This project uses the Expo framework; follow their excellent [installation guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) to get a development environment set up. You'll need to [sign up for an account](https://expo.dev/signup) and get invited to the [project](https://expo.dev/accounts/steve.kuznetsov/projects/avalanche-forecast).

We use the following global packages:

```
npm install -g npm@8.19.3 yarn@1.22.10
```

## Local Secrets

For development, you will need a number of environment variables set to secret values. The canonical approach is to store them in a `.env` file at the root of the repository. Make sure to provide the following values:

- `ANDROID_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- `IOS_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- `SENTRY_API_TOKEN`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`

These secrets can be uploaded to the Expo servers if they ever become out-of-sync with:

```shell
eas secret:push --env-file=.env
```

## Logging

The log level for our logger is set with `$LOG_LEVEL`, the default is `'info'` but it needs to be `'debug'` for the below network bits.

Runtime logging can be enabled in development mode by running `npx expo start` with the following environment variables set:

`$LOG_NETWORK`:

- `'queries'`: queries issues to `react-query` will be logged along with their query keys; note that these may be fulfilled by the cache
- `'requests'`: outgoing requests using `axios` will be logged
- `'responses'`: incoming responses using `axios` will be logged along with their result status code
- `'response-bodies'`: incoming response bodies using `axios` will be logged
- `'all'`: all of the above will be logged

`$LOG_NETWORK_MATCHING`: the value of this variable will be used to filter what is logged, using simple sub-string matches on the formatted URL with query parameters (e.g. `url.includes(log_network_matching)`).

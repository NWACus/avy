# Getting involved

Since you have landed on this page, we assume that you want to help us with Avy. Amazing. We love it.

You can start by looking at our list of issues. We do our best to keep the tags on those updated best we can. If you see an issue that you want to tackle, feel free to fork the repo and suggest a PR to fix/add the issues. One of the developers of the project should respond within a few days. If the issue is not assigned to someone, it means no one is currently working on it.

Things to look at and get engaged on:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/NWACus/avy/labels/good%20first%20issue)
- [Bugs](https://github.com/NWACus/avy/labels/bug)

If you found an issue you'd like to work on but need more context, it is best to ask questions directly in the issue. The repo issues are monitored by volunteers and NWAC staff who would be able to help provide more details when needed.

You can email us at developer@nwac.us to request to be added to our Slack channel where you can sign up to help with larger issues with a more specific timeline and talk with other volunteers who are helping out with Avy.

Lastly, please fill out the form linked at the [bottom of this page](https://nwac.us/technology-volunteer-outreach/) so we know who you are and what you're interested in!

# Developer Environment

This project uses the Expo framework; follow their excellent [installation guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) to get a development environment set up.

If you plan to build a development build of the app using EAS instead of running in the Expo Go sandbox, you'll need to [sign up for an account](https://expo.dev/signup) and get invited to the [project](https://expo.dev/accounts/steve.kuznetsov/projects/avalanche-forecast). If you do not need to do either of those things, you will not need access to the project to proceed with development.

We use the following global packages:

```
npm install -g npm@8.19.3 yarn@1.22.10
```

Currently the team primarily uses the Expo Go sandbox when debugging/testing issues, either inside an Android emulator or with actual hardware connected via USB to the development machine. We have a preview app published on both the Android Play Store and Apple App Store for staging changes that cannot be tested inside the sandbox.

## Local Secrets

For development with Expo Go, you should be able to run the app with an empty `.env` file in the root of the repository.

If working outside of Expo Go, you will need a number of environment variables set to secret values. You would populate them in a `.env` file at the root of the repository. Make sure to include the following values:

- `ANDROID_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- `IOS_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- `SENTRY_API_TOKEN`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`

These secrets can be uploaded to the Expo servers if they ever become out-of-sync with:

```shell
eas secret:push --env-file=.env
```

If you do not wish to populate your own values, reach out to developer@nwac.us for our test values or reach out to us through our slack volunteer channel.

## Logging

The log level for our logger is set with `$LOG_LEVEL`, the default is `'info'` but it needs to be `'debug'` for the below network bits.

Runtime logging can be enabled in development mode by running `npx expo start` with the following environment variables set:

`$LOG_NETWORK`:

- `'queries'`: queries issues to `react-query` will be logged along with their query keys; note that these may be fulfilled by the cache
- `'requests'`: outgoing requests using `axios` will be logged
- `'responses'`: incoming responses using `axios` will be logged along with their result status code
- `'response-bodies'`: incoming response bodies using `axios` will be logged
- `'all'`: all of the above will be logged

`$LOG_NETWORK_MATCHING`: the value of this variable will be used to filter what is logged, using simple sub-string matches on the formatted URL with query parameters (e.g. `url.includes(log_network_matching)`).
